# What is Quadra?

# Running on a Car

For running Quadra on your car, you need: 

 - A supported machine to run Quadra i.e. A windows/linux PC or an android phone.
 - A white / grey panda with giraffe or a black/red panda with car harness. 
 - 1x USB-A to USB-A cable for connecting panda to PC and aditionally, an OTG cable is required if connecting panda to phone.
 - One of the [200+ supported cars](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/CARS.md). The community supports Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Kia, Chrysler, Lexus, Acura, Audi, VW, and more. If your car is not supported but has adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist, it's likely able to run Quadra.
